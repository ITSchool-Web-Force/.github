# The Web Force

On December 13, 2022, a few awesome people chose their name for the [Web Development course](https://itschool.ro/cursuri/curs-web-development-online)
they were starting. After a vote, they decided to call themselves "Web Force".

The course is organized by [ITSchool Romania](https://itschool.ro/), and presented by [Cornel](https://github.com/vladutcornel). 

This GitHub organisation will be used to submit homework and projects for code review.
